# Dashboard Component Truth Contract

Dashboard components are presentation surfaces. They do not own OmniNode truth.

All widgets in this directory must follow the [OmniNode deterministic truth doctrine](https://github.com/OmniNode-ai/omni_home/blob/main/docs/standards/OMNINODE_DETERMINISTIC_TRUTH_DOCTRINE.md).

## Authoritative Data Boundaries

Dashboard components may consume data only through approved dashboard surfaces:

- `useProjectionQuery(...)` for projection snapshots.
- `src/data-source/` adapters selected by `VITE_DATA_SOURCE`.
- Contracted HTTP projection/API surfaces exposed through those adapters.
- Approved browser subscription surfaces when they invalidate or append display data from the same contracted topic.

Dashboard components must not:

- read Postgres or any backend database directly;
- import Kafka, Redpanda, Redis, Postgres, Prisma, Drizzle, or Node transport clients;
- infer authoritative state by merging unrelated streams;
- deduplicate authoritative records except by contracted message identity;
- implement projection reducers or lifecycle FSM semantics in React state;
- fabricate consistency when data is missing, stale, or degraded.

## Component State Is Presentation State

React state in widgets may hold presentation-only concerns:

- selected chart dimension or style;
- hover, tooltip, search, collapsed, paused-scroll, and active-tab state;
- bounded display buffers for already-authorized data;
- local loading, empty, and error presentation.

React state must not become the source of truth for:

- lifecycle status;
- queue position;
- build, dispatch, registration, or verification outcomes;
- cross-topic joins;
- freshness, ordering, or cursor progress.

If a widget needs one of those values, add or consume an authoritative projection/API surface first.

## Stories and Tests

Every data-driven widget story must seed deterministic fixture data through `makeDashboardDecorator(...)` or `DataSourceTestProvider`. Mocks and fixtures prove component behavior only; they do not prove runtime truth.

Runtime truth claims require durable evidence outside this repo, such as OCC receipts, CI checks, PR review records, Linear evidence, or an approved artifact store.
