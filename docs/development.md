# OmniDash — Development Guide

**Owner:** `omnidash`
**Last verified:** 2026-06-16
**Verification:** `npm run check && npm run test:run`

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version managed by the project).
- `npm` (bundled with Node.js).
- No backend services required for dev mode.

---

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Data Source Modes

OmniDash runs in four modes selected by the `VITE_DATA_SOURCE` environment variable. Default values are generated from `contract.yaml` into `src/config/generated/data-source-defaults.ts` — run `npm run generate:config` after editing `contract.yaml`.

### File mode (default)

```bash
npm run dev
# or explicitly:
VITE_DATA_SOURCE=file npm run dev
```

Reads data from `./fixtures/<topic>/` JSON files. Persists layouts to `./dashboard-layouts/`. Both directories are gitignored. Zero infrastructure required.

### HTTP mode

```bash
VITE_DATA_SOURCE=http npm run dev
```

Reads via the projection backend at `http://localhost:3002`. Requires the projection backend to be running.

### SQLite and Postgres modes

```bash
VITE_DATA_SOURCE=sqlite npm run dev
VITE_DATA_SOURCE=postgres npm run dev
```

Both resolve through `HttpSnapshotSource` pointing at the projection backend. The distinction is server-side; the frontend uses the same HTTP read path as `http` mode.

**Hard rule:** Do NOT hardcode `localhost:3002` in source files. All data access goes through `src/data-source/` adapters. Do NOT read `VITE_DATA_SOURCE` directly in components — always call `resolveEffectiveDataSource()` from `src/data-source/data-source-override.ts`, which layers the runtime chrome override over env defaults.

### Runtime override

The `DataSourceControl` chrome component allows switching the active backend at runtime without restarting. It writes a persisted override via `src/data-source/data-source-override.ts`. This is the single seam — there is no per-widget or per-mode env read outside this module.

## Adding a New Widget

### Track A: Local MVP widget

Use this track for all in-repo widgets.

1. Create `src/components/dashboard/<name>/<Name>.tsx`. Default-export a React component that accepts a `config` prop shaped per its manifest's `configSchema`.

2. Register the lazy import in `src/components/dashboard/index.ts`:
   ```ts
   '<name>/<Name>': lazy(() => import('./<name>/<Name>')),
   ```

3. Add a manifest entry to `MVP_COMPONENTS` in `scripts/generate-registry.ts`:
   ```ts
   '<name>/<Name>': {
     name: '<name>',
     displayName: 'Widget Display Name',
     // ...full ComponentManifest fields
   }
   ```

4. Run registry generation:
   ```bash
   npm run generate:registry
   ```

5. Add at minimum `Empty` and `Populated` Storybook stories as `<Name>.stories.tsx` alongside the component. The compliance test enforces this on every `npm test`.

6. Add unit tests as `<Name>.test.tsx` alongside the component.

### Track B: External package widget

External widgets come from `@omninode/*` npm packages.

1. The package must declare manifests in its `package.json`:
   ```json
   "dashboardComponents": "./path/to/manifests.json"
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   npm install @omninode/<package-name>
   ```

3. Run registry generation to pick up the new manifests:
   ```bash
   npm run generate:registry
   ```

4. The widget appears in the palette with `status: 'not_implemented'` until its `implementationKey` is also registered in the local `componentImports` map in `src/components/dashboard/index.ts`.

---

## Registry Generation

`scripts/generate-registry.ts` is the single source of truth for what appears in the palette. It:

- Reads `MVP_COMPONENTS` for in-repo widgets.
- Auto-scans `node_modules/@omninode/*` for external package manifests.
- Writes `src/registry/component-registry.json`.

Run it after any manifest change:

```bash
npm run generate:registry
```

The output file is committed. Do not hand-edit it.

If the palette is empty after changes, the registry is likely stale — run `npm run generate:registry` and restart the dev server.

---

## Regenerating All Artifacts

If starting from a fresh clone or after major changes:

```bash
npm run types:generate
npm run generate:fixtures
npm run generate:registry
npm run dev
```

---

## Storybook

Storybook runs on port 6006:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

**Story conventions:**

- Stories live alongside components as `<Name>.stories.tsx`.
- Every widget must export at minimum `Empty` and `Populated` stories.
- Widgets that call `useProjectionQuery` must wrap stories with `makeDashboardDecorator(...)` from `@/storybook/decorators/withDashboardContext`.
- Fixtures live under `src/storybook/fixtures/`. Extend existing fixtures rather than duplicating.

The compliance test `src/storybook-coverage-compliance.test.ts` runs as part of `npm test` and fails if any registered widget is missing required stories.

---

## Backend Assumptions

OmniDash reads data from the ONEX runtime via:

- HTTP polling via `useProjectionQuery` against the projection backend. Live updates are poll-driven — there is no WebSocket connection. The `/ws` path was permanently removed: it was rejected with a 403 by the projection backend and never delivered events. Raw browser WebSocket construction is blocked by the `local/no-projection-websocket` ESLint rule.
- HTTP endpoints exposed by the projection backend at `localhost:3002` in http/sqlite/postgres modes.

These endpoints are provided by the ONEX runtime running on the runtime host. In dev mode, fixture files replace live data entirely and no runtime connection is needed.

The runtime topology is documented in `omni_home/CLAUDE.md` under "Infrastructure Topology".

---

## Gotchas

- **Palette is empty:** `src/registry/component-registry.json` is stale. Run `npm run generate:registry`.
- **Widgets show "no data":** `./fixtures/<topic>/` is missing JSON files or `./fixtures/registry.json` does not list the topic. Run `npm run generate:fixtures`.
- **Edit mode drag/resize not working:** Edit mode is toggled via the `editModeSlice` in Zustand. It must be active. Check `src/store/editModeSlice.ts`.
- **Layout changes not persisting:** Layout does not auto-save on drag. Use the explicit Save button. Layouts write to `./dashboard-layouts/` (gitignored).
- **Types under `src/shared/types/generated/` are wrong:** Run `npm run types:generate` to regenerate from the JSON schema sources.
