# ADR 004 — Cross-renderer typed empty-state gate (OMN-13131, W6)

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-06-18
Ticket: OMN-13131 (Phase 1, W6; gates G-H and G-I)

## Context

Phase 1 of the contract-driven UI platform makes "no blind/blank render" a
mechanical invariant. When the renderer-capability projection (W5) is stale,
absent, or unsatisfiable, the dispatch surface must render a **typed**
`EnumEmptyStateReason` — specifically `UPSTREAM_BLOCKED` — never a blank element
and never a crash (G-H). The enforcement that backs this (G-I) was previously
`local/no-projection-fallback`, which keys on React's `useProjectionQuery` hook
and so was effectively React/chart-only.

## Decision

1. **Typed empty state (G-H).** The W4 `CapabilityDispatcher` miss path is wired
   to a renderer-agnostic `TypedEmptyState`. `resolveCapabilityEmptyState`
   classifies a degraded (`is_degraded`), absent (no rows), or unsatisfiable
   capability read as `upstream-blocked`. `VizRenderer` renders the typed empty
   state on a dispatcher miss. The typed reason VALUE is exposed on
   `data-empty-state-reason` so the state is machine-verifiable.

2. **Cross-renderer gate (G-I).** A new ESLint rule
   `local/no-untyped-empty-state` generalizes the no-projection enforcement
   beyond React/charts. It applies to the whole cross-renderer file set
   (`src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`, `shared/**/*.ts`, `server/**/*.ts`) and flags any
   empty-state-reason literal that is not one of the four canonical values.

3. **Key on VALUES, not the symbol name (plan §0b.5).** The hand-authored chart
   type is `EmptyStateReason`; the generated mirror is `EnumEmptyStateReason`.
   Both carry the same four values. The rule keys on the VALUES
   (`no-data` | `missing-field` | `upstream-blocked` | `schema-invalid`) so it is
   agnostic to which symbol — or no symbol — a given renderer imports.

## Cross-renderer scope (G-I proof)

The gate is **not** chart-only and **not** React-only:

- Rule scope spans plain `.ts` modules and `server/**` (Node, non-React) in
  addition to React `.tsx`.
- `src/no-untyped-empty-state.test.ts` exercises the rule against a **plain,
  non-React, non-chart `.ts` surface** (`src/__lint_fixture_empty_state.ts`),
  proving it fires and stays silent independent of React/JSX/chart context.

The canonical reason vocabulary lives once in
`shared/types/empty-state-reason.ts` (`EMPTY_STATE_REASONS`,
`EmptyStateReasonValue`), re-exporting the generated mirror's
`EnumEmptyStateReason` type so every renderer and the gate share one value set.

## Consequences

- Adding a new empty-state reason requires editing the canonical Python enum,
  regenerating the TS mirror, and updating `EMPTY_STATE_REASONS` +
  `CANONICAL_REASON_VALUES` in the rule in lockstep. There is intentionally no
  inline-disable escape hatch — a new reason is a platform-vocabulary change.
- A renderer that invents a reason synonym (`'error'`, `'not-found'`, `'blank'`)
  fails lint regardless of platform.
