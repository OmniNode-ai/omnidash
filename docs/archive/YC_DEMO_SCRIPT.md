# OmniNode - YC Demo Video Script (2 minutes)

## Opening (10 seconds)
"Every engineering team wastes hours waiting for AI agents to figure out what they already know. We're OmniNode—we give AI agents persistent memory across your entire organization's codebase. 

Let me show you what that unlocks."

## Pattern Capture & Injection (40 seconds)
"This is our Code Intelligence Suite. We're constantly scanning your codebase and automatically capturing working patterns—authentication flows, API architectures, error handling, database patterns.

Here in Pattern Learning, you can see we've discovered 125 proven patterns across this codebase. Each one is a working solution your team has already built and tested.

Now here's the game-changer: when any AI agent needs to solve a problem—let's say implement OAuth—we automatically inject the exact pattern you're already using into that agent's context. No more agents inventing solutions that don't match your architecture. They use YOUR patterns, YOUR conventions, every single time.

This is what actually makes agents useful in production—they build code that looks like it was written by your team, because they're learning from your team."

## Tech Debt & Duplicate Detection (35 seconds)
"Now look at this—we analyze tech debt across ALL your repositories, not just one project.

In Tech Debt Analysis, we're showing 250 hours of debt with 8 critical issues ranked by impact. We tell you exactly what to fix first.

And here's where it gets really powerful: Duplicate Detection. We found this same authentication logic implemented 15 different ways across your organization. We show you every duplicate, tell you which one is the best implementation, and generate a refactoring plan ranked by impact. 

You're not just finding duplicates—you're getting a prioritized roadmap to consolidate them."

## Agent Management & ROI (25 seconds)
"All of this powers our Agent Management system. We're processing 1,200 agent requests daily with 94% success rate. 

Because agents are using captured patterns instead of re-analyzing code, we're seeing 34% reduction in token usage and $45,000 in monthly compute savings. Response time dropped from 2.5 seconds to 1.2 seconds."

## Closing (10 seconds)
"Traditional AI agents are amnesiacs. OmniNode gives them institutional knowledge.

We're live with three customers processing 15,000 requests daily. We're raising to bring this to every engineering team."

## Navigation Guide for Recording

**Screen flow:**
1. **Start:** Code Intelligence Suite → Pattern Learning tab (0:10)
   - Show pattern count, scroll through patterns
   - Emphasize "these are YOUR working solutions"

2. **Transition:** Click Tech Debt Analysis in sidebar (0:50)
   - Point to total debt hours
   - Point to critical issues ranked by priority
   
3. **Next:** Click Duplicate Detection tab (1:00)
   - Show duplicate code instances
   - Point to "15 implementations" number
   - Show refactoring priority list

4. **Finish:** Click Agent Management in sidebar (1:25)
   - Show live agent activity
   - Point to success rate and savings metrics

**Key metrics to emphasize:**
- 125 patterns captured (scale of learning)
- 250 hours tech debt (visibility)
- 15 duplicate implementations (waste identified)
- 94% agent success rate (reliability)
- $45,000 monthly savings (ROI)
- 34% token reduction (efficiency)

**Tone & pacing:**
- Confident and clear
- Slow down on "we automatically inject the exact pattern" (key differentiator)
- Emphasize "ALL your repositories" (enterprise scale)
- Let "$45,000 in monthly savings" breathe
- End with momentum

**Visual cues while recording:**
- Hover over pattern cards when mentioning them
- Circle the priority rankings with cursor
- Let numbers stay on screen for 2 seconds

**What NOT to show:**
- Mock data badges (edit them out if visible)
- Empty states or loading screens
- Configuration or settings pages
